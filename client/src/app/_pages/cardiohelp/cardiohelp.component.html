          This application records the outcomes of the use of the CardioHelp machine
This CardioHelp machine gives extracorporeal support for, amongst others, pulmonary and cardiac
conditions. The CardioHelp machine collects a huge amount of hemodynamic, operational
and alarm conditions, up to 54 variables every 5 minutes. To manage these data it is very helpful
to have a dedicated, cloud based, web application. With these data neatly stored in the cloud we can
learn to finetune the indications for extracorporeal support. These data are
anonymously collected and therefore there are no patient privacy concerns.
